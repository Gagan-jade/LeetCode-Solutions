# Problem Statement

**Given** the head of a linked list, **remove the nth node from the end of the list** and return its head.

### Input
- `head`: The head of the linked list.
- `n`: An integer representing the position of the node to remove from the end of the list.

### Output
- The head of the linked list after the nth node from the end has been removed.

### Example

#### Input
```plaintext
head = [1,2,3,4,5]
n = 2
```

#### Output
```plaintext
[1,2,3,5]
```

### Constraints
1. The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
2. `1 <= sz <= 30`.
3. `0 <= Node.val <= 100`.
4. `1 <= n <= sz`.
